* I will accept pull requests that help with orthography and grammar.
* I will be particularly happy if you review my work and give feedback via the comment function of GitHub or via pull requests.
I am also trying to live stream while writing on https://twitch.tv/renepickhardt.
I encourage you to show up and give feedback while I am writing. 

Before you write substantial parts and make a pull request contact me or expect that I won't merge your pull request. Creating educational content is not so much about collecting a bunch of knowledge but more about presenting it in a concise way.
Therefore I have to be careful about collaboration. This does not mean that I am not open for collaboration.

All contributors (people who make a pull request) must transfer a non-exclusive, non-revocable, sub-licensable, worldwide, royalty-free license to me since potential publishers will require this from me. I will include a list of contributors at the end of the book. There will also be a list of donors (if they want to be included).

## Formatting
* I try to write one sentence per line as this will hopefully confuse the merge algorithm of git as little as possible. Please don't reformat the entire text. In particular if you also have other changes as I will almost have no chance to review your pull request.

## Translations
Since the book is still in the process of being written I do not encourage people to start translating the book to other languages yet. However it would be great if at a later stage you want to translate the book. If you are willing to do that please contact me.
